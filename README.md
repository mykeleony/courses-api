# Courses API

<p> This project is a REST API developed in Java and Spring Framework for managing courses for a fictitious digital curatorship. </p>

<p> In fact, it is an exemplary practical application of the technologies: </p>

- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management
- [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for initial settings simplification
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing API consumer HTTP requests
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for storing courses information

## [Spring Projects](https://spring.io/projects) used

Spring projects accelerated the API development process, especially with the use of features such as Spring Initializr, Spring WEB, SpringBoot Devtools, SpringBoot Validation, and so on.

- [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
- [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data)
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data)

## How does it work?
The API must perform all <strong>CRUD</strong> operations. That is: <b>C</b>reate, <b>R</b>ead (list), <b>U</b>pdate and <b>D</b>elete courses. For this, the chosen *endpoints* were:

### GET Methods

`/api/courses`: lists all courses.

`/api/courses/i`: returns the *i* course, where *i* is the integer number that represents the course id.
<br> <br>

#### Response example
<code>
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Spring",
        "category": "Back-end"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Angular",
        "category": "Front-end"
    }
]
</code>
<br> <br>

<br> <br>

<br> <br>

#### Body structure example

  "name": "Spring",
  "category": "Back-end"
}
</code>
<br> <br>

  <br> <br>

<br> <br>

#### Body structure example
